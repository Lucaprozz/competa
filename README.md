### Why did i not accomplish the job?

To begin with i am not good at Javascript at all.<br>
I tried my best to do it. But almost everything is from the internet.<br>

I did not now how to use the buttons for play and slide.
I tried my very best but im just not good at it. I really want to learn it.
So here are my files. <br> I apologize for not finishing the assignment.
